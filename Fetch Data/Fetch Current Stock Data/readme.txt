As machine learning practitioners, we need to collect stock price data for regression analysis and time series analysis. We can easily download it from Yahoo Finance. 
But imagine if we want to create an application where we can analyze the real-time stock prices, we need to collect the latest dataset instead of using the downloaded dataset.

To use this API, we need to install it by using the "pip" command in our terminal or command prompt as mentioned below:
    1. pip install yfinance

The final dataset on the output screen is just like the dataset that we download from Yahoo Finance. 
This is how we can get stock price data using Python.
