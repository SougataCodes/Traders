Its a python code to fetch and analyze the real-time stock prices, this collects the latest dataset by using the API of Yahoo Finance instead of using the downloaded dataset.

To use this API, we need to install it by using the "pip" command in our terminal or command prompt as mentioned below:
    1. pip install yfinance

The final dataset on the output screen is just like the dataset that we download from Yahoo Finance.
This is how we can get stock price data using this Python code.
